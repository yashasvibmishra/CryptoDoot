Investing in cryptocurrencies and other Initial Coin Offerings ("ICOs") is very dangerous and speculative, and this report does not constitute a suggestion dossier by CryptoDoot to do so. Because each person's circumstance is different, one should always get advice from a knowledgeable finance specialist before making any financial decisions. 

Future outlook of CryptoDoot
Bitcoin remains the most popular of all available Crypto Currencies, it has become the talk of the town even people with the idle tongues are not spared from it.
But CryptoCurrencies like Bitcoin are extremely sensitive and subjected to market fluctuations, even a small disturbance in the market (like tweets by some renowned personalities) can change the valuation and it becomes very difficult to keep a track of changing prices. For this very reason I was motivated to develop this bot.

Since ,the project and present market demand are going hand in hand, it fills my heart with joy unspeakable to share the future plannings with the readers for our very friendly telegram bot(CryptoDoot).
From the very beginning my philosophy had always been to develop and deploy something which has far-reaching benefits for the users.
In order to do so here are 5 developments which I am looking to add on the existing project for the future:-

1. Access and Availability:-
	As we can see more and more governments, lawmakers and experts are trying to mandate crypto currencies by any means be it taxation or changing legal status which indicates that there is a bright future ahead for people involving in Crypto trading which is suffice to make the bot available for any user with a computer and little knowledge of python. I am assuming the user to be having thorough or bare minimum knowledge of Crypto Currencies in order to use the bot to its fullest.
	I am considering to create a Python Package Index popularly known as PyPi, it is a kind a repository for our bot which means typing
 “pip install CryptoDoot “
in a Python working environment shall install all the packages present in it on the system. After this the developer can import the desired packages from CryptoDoot library.
Here is the proper documentation of PyPi.
 2. Diversifying Portfolio:-
	At present the bot is limited to only Bitcoin but I am considering adding various other Crypto Currencies so as to make our bot more dynamic and attract more like minded.
 3. Live Features:-
 	At present Telegram is devoid of features to host live and real-time data like live plotting. I view telegram in a positive sense of adding this kind of feature to their app, even if they are not I shall look into alternatives like hosting live data and sending a URL in the chat on user’s request.
 4. Creating a channel:-
	At present we are limited to a bot but with the passing of time I am considering making a channel out of our it which shall have a ton of features like polling or blogging for starters. Certainly it will make it more user friendly and robust bots to perform at command of yours.
 	If required it shall be promoted or even purchase bots so that no user misses out what he/she deserves.
 5. Discussion Forums
	Discussion groups shall be added to the channel so that admins can provide a whole new chat section associated with the channel and if participants want to add their opinion on a particular topic, they have a way to initiate a discussion on a separate extended group chat attached to the channel.
